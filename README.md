 This folder contains my submission to the assignment `Human Resources` in the course PRO192x_2.1-A_VN (Object-Oriented Programming with Java), a part of the path Software Engineering provided by FUNiX.



## About the project

- The project simulates a simple program to manage human resources. And to fulfill this, the project covers Java basics and OOP (the UI is just simple print-outs on console): expressions with variables of different types in Java, printing out in console, loops in Java, Scanner.in to get user input, handle with value-return methods, comparator to sort collections as well as use formatter to print out with specified styles in console.

- **Keyword**: _Java basics, collections, object-oriented programming, OOP, comparator, printf, formatter_.
